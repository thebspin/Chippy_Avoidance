Just to clarify, the MIT lisence only applies to original content that I've made myself. 
This includes .gd (GDScript), .blend (Blender) and .pdn (Paint.net) files. 

Other assets & resources may or may not be open-sourced.
You must NOT use, modify, sell, or redistrubute anything that's not under the MIT lisence!

If you wish to fix the audio issues, please roll back to a previous commit where the Audio folder is present.
